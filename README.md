jUO
===

Juo is (for the moment) a very basic proof of concept for a ultima online java server that wants to recreate a uo t2a experience, there are actually some shards that try to create the same atmosphere but they (all ?) use a relative new version of the client, I have the feeling that one of the thing that created the aforementioned atmosphere was the lightness and the responsiveness of the client itself, so.. this is it.

(the server works only for the client ver. 1.26.4 (patched to use a decrypted connection))

Note: in order to start the server the following files *must* be copied into /src/main/resources before building the project:
1) map0.mul
